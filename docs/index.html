        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Our objective for our project Particles All the Way Down was to be able to make abstract 2D scenes with custom particles that we add to a codebase with interactive parameters such as material modeling, light, and particle interaction. This gave us the most room for creativity and to demonstrate some topics we learned in this class, such as simulating simplified particle systems, ray tracing and RT acceleration, and rendering pipeline techniques. We were influenced by Noita, a game where there is an array of particles, each of which acts differently with each other and the environment. We were also influenced heavily by the blackhole simulator and wanted to find a way to merge the two ideas. Our code starting point was a hefty particle simulating codebase made by MrFrenik with many particles already implemented, giving us an excellent starting spot. We then proceeded to implement lighting effects. We included: one bounce illumination, a mobile light source, multiple light sources, a 3-d lighting effect, and variable transparency depending on the type of particle. We then set to create a special types of particles. We created a magnetic particle that attracted other particles in the vicinity to it. Our last and ambition plan was to create a black hole particle with all the attributes of a black hole. We found this especially difficult to do, especially in a 2 dimensional space, and were not quite able to complete it.
