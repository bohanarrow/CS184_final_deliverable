# CS184_final_deliverable

This project was developed by Andrew Yeh, Matthew Bronars, Prabhman Dhaliawl, and Tyler Bohan.

This project's boilerplate code was taken from MrFrenik's Noita Game Sim project, and gave us a basic particle system to work with. 
The github link is here: https://github.com/GameEngineering/EP01_SandSim

The purpose of this final project was to create a 2D particle sim with a dynamic lighting system and particles. Since many of the simpler particles were implemented in the boilerplate, 
we added 2 new complex particles to the system as well as some raytracing aspects to give the scene proper lighting. This allowed us to showcase course material relating to 
raytracing and the physical simulation lectures. 

Details on implementation can be found on the final deliverables website.
